# Solar Energy Predictor


## About the Project
This project was made for my dad. He recently installed solar panels, however had no estimation of how much energy they could produce to power our home. A problem arises here as it's difficult to plan usage (EV charging, appliances, etc.), judging dependeability and reliability of this form of energy, as well as the pay off period. With this, I developed an application to answer a simple, high-impact question for homeowners:

*“Given my location and the week's weather forecase, how much power will my array generate on any given day?”*

## Usage 
Solar adoption is accelerating - especially in high-insolation states like Texas and Arizona. This full-stack AI/ML app targets that growing market by giving homeowners a practical way to forecast daily and weekly generation. With roughly 7% of U.S. homes using solar today and projections approaching ~15% by 2030, tools that turn weather data into expected output help users plan loads, optimize storage, and understand ROI—making residential solar more predictable and valuable. With that being said, here is how my application works : 

1. Sign in with Google (One-tap or button).
2. Search/select your address on the map.
3. Choose date(s) → get predictions

## ⭐ Highlights (that I am very proud of)
- 🗺️ **Google Maps API** for location search & geocoding
- ☁️ **National Weather Service** live forecast ingestion
- 🔐 **Google Sign-In** (GIS) with secure JWT sessions
- 📦 **API-first** endpoints for predictions and auth
  
## Additional Notes
I am in the process of deploying this.
